Electrophysiology (patch clamp,\\nmulti-channel recording, LFPs, EEG, MEG) measures and manipulates neuronal\\ndynamics such as spike trains, EPSC, EPSP, and LFP. Imaging techniques (fMRI,\\nPET, calcium imaging, OIS, VSDI) can capture neuronal activities and identify\\nstructures and connections at different scales, from cortex areas and neurons to\\ndendrites and spines. Each technology has advantages and disadvantages regarding\\ninvasiveness and temporal and spatial resolution. Therefore, combining two or more\\ntechnologies to reveal the complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity from\\na single neuron to the population level is common.

Neuronal spiking is assessed by measuring changes in fluorescence.\\nCalcium imaging together with recombinant DNA technologies and microscopy is\\na powerful tool in modulating and visualizing cellular and molecular interactions.\\nIt can be used not only to observe neuronal activity but also to associate behav-\\nioral characterization with physiological states. Under the field of view (FOV), it is\\npossible to record the activities of hundreds of neurons. It also enables recording free-\\nmoving animals in in-vivo experiments. Two-photon microscopy has excellent spatial\\nresolution, but because the calcium signal is slow, two-photon calcium imaging has\\nvery good spatial resolution but low temporal resolution. Although experiments’\\nsetup and execution could be demanding, calcium imaging can be combined with\\n, \\nelectrophysiology to compensate the low temporal resolution. Figure 2 is an exam-\\nple. Intra-cellular recording directly measures neuronal activities, usually taken as\\nground truth. Calcium imaging records fluorescence signals as an indicator of neu-\\nronal spiking activity, which is indirect. Fluorescence signals and neuronal spikes\\ndiffer from each other.

The interaction of calcium ions between the extracellular milieu\\nand intracellular space generates the dynamics of calcium activity. There are mainly\\nthree types of calcium channels on the membrane. See Figure 4. The first is voltage-\\ngated calcium channels (VGCC); the second is receptor-operated calcium channels\\n(ROC); the third is store-operated calcium channels (SOC). VGCC responds to elec-\\ntrical signals induced by calcium binding. It helps to propagate electrical impulses.\\n, \\nFigure 3: Fluorescence signal evoked by a single action potential, adapted from [3].\\nA: intracellular recording. B: Calcium imaging of A.

D: Presynaptic fluorescence signals evoked by\\na single action potential in cells loaded with Fura-2.\\nROC is a calcium-permeable receptor channel. They are open when binding with\\nexcitatory neurotransmitters, e.g., glutamate, AmPAR, NMDA. Besides, the endo-\\nplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria can release calcium intracellularly. SOC\\nis activated by stromal interaction molecule (STIM) proteins accumulated at ER\\nand plasma membrane (PM) junctions [4]. In excitatory neurons, when membrane\\nis depolarized, VGCC open and calcium enormously flux in. Therefore calcium con-\\ncentration is associated with action potential events. Helmchen 2012 [5] summarized\\ncalcium dynamics as four processes: calcium binding, influx, extrusion, and diffusion.\\nCalcium influx will increase the intracellular concentration. Extrusion is, therefore,\\nimportant to keep a low intracellular calcium concentration at a balanced level. In\\naddition, free calcium ions, as well as calcium-binding molecules, e.g., most cal-\\ncium indicators, can diffuse. Mathematical equations were used to describe the four\\nprocesses. There are various models for them. For example calcium microdomain\\nmodels high calcium concentration in small spatial scale beneath the membrane due\\nto opening of calcium-permeable channel pores (diffusion process). An 1-dimensional\\ndiffusion model to depict the radial distance dependent calcium redistribution pro-\\ncesses. A leaky ”chemical” cable analogue can model calcium diffusion, extrusion\\nand buffering. In a simplified single-compartment model, an exponential function\\ncan be used to describe the kinetics of the binding process. The calcium signal from\\na neuron is a convolution of the spikes with this exponential function as proposed [5].\\nIn biological calcium imaging experiments, fluorescent calcium indicators is needed\\n, \\nto serve as a proxy for the change of calcium concentration during binding process.\\nFigure 4: Intracelluar calcium dynamics [4].\\nFigure 5: GCaMP working mechanism [4].\\n]</td>\n",

Nowadays, the\\nindicators used in calcium imaging can be classified into two categories: organic dyes\\nand genetically-encoded calcium indicators(GECIs). The former are small organic\\n, \\nmolecule indicators,e.g. Oregon Green BAPTA-1. The latter are calcium-sensitive\\nfluorescent proteins, which further have two major classes: FRET-based indicators\\nand single protein indicator. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hap-\\npens on the distance change between a donor fluorescent protein and an acceptor\\nfluorescent protein, which can be induced by a conformation change via calcium\\nbinding to the linker. FRET leads to fluorescence emissions so that the intensity\\ncan be recorded. Single protein indicator e.g. the GCaMP family, are circularly per-\\nmutated protein that can sense the conformational change made by calcium binding,\\nmediated by the fluorescence intensity of chromophore inside [5]. GCaMP is a syn-\\nthetic protein containing green fluorscent protein (GFP), calmodulin and a peptide\\nsequence M13 (Figure 5). When bounding to calcium, it emits green luminance\\nwith a peak excitation wavelength of 480 nm and a peak emission wavelength of\\n510 nm. Comparing with organic dyes, GECIs has an advantage of being able to\\ntarget on location in the brain, specific neuron types and subcellular compartments\\nsuch as soma or axons. GECIs also has higher signal-to-noise ratio. To be noticed\\nis, calcium indicator itself has an influence on the intracellular calcium dynamics,\\nwhich can inference the readout information. Besides that, different indicators have\\ndifferent response times, which is an important factor of data modeling. In a recent\\nwork [6], with a large dataset of curated ground truth recordings on zebrafish and\\nmouse, covering different calcium indicators and induction methods, excitatory and\\ninhibitory neurons, different sampling frequency and different brain regions, using\\nregularized deconvolution to generate the linear kernels of fluorescence transient.\\nThe kernels are optimized such that the trace ∆F/F is maximal approximated by\\nconvolving the ground truth spike train with the kernel. It was found that depending\\non animal types, brain regions, neuron types and calcium indicators, the area under\\nthe kernel curve varied. Figure 6 shows different peak amplitudes and decay times\\nwith different calcium indicators. Even for neurons within same dataset, the kernels\\nappear in diversity as well. This suggests that single neuron responds differently\\nwhen underlying action potential goes on.\\n, \\nFigure 6:\\nKernels with different calcium indicator, adapted from [6].\\nAcross\\ndatasets as well as within datasets, kernels vary in terms of amplitude and shape.\\nm: mouse, zf: zebrafish.\\n]</td>\n",

In the meantime, analyzing fluorescence signals is more complex\\nthan analyzing signals from electrophysiology. The raw data of calcium imaging\\nis movie or image stacks. A common benchmark of data analysis involves motion\\ncorrection, source extraction, cell registration, spike inference, and further analysis\\nof spike trains. Spike inference is very challenging among these steps. Assuming\\nfluorescence signal is the result of action potentials convolving a response function.\\nTo infer the underlying spike train is a so-called \"inverse problem.\" Various methods\\nhave been developed to solve the inverse problem: deconvolution techniques [7, 8],\\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) principle [9], template-matching-based approach [10],\\napproximate Bayesian inference [11]. Applications and packages are available online:\\nCellSort [12], CaImAn [13], Suite2P [14], MLspike [15], CASCADE [6] and so on. It\\nhas been great progress with these works. However, general difficulties in terms of\\nspike inference still exist. The main aspects are outlined below.\\n, \\n• Overexpression.\\nFluorescence overexpression potentially leads to toxicity.\\nNeuron nuclear is bright due to the accumulation of calcium indicators.\\n• Photobleaching. The fluorescence signal fades during the experiment due to\\nthe photochemical destruction of the fluorophore.\\n• Nonlinearity of fluorescence. The saturation curve of the calcium-binding\\nratio can be linearly approximated only within a limited range. Therefore the\\namplitude of observed fluorescence signals does not always linearly represent\\nthe number of underlying action potentials.\\n• Sample resolution. With high microscopy resolution, the single action po-\\ntential is more visible. The low resolution of imaging could lead to missing\\naction potentials.\\n• Noise. Deconvolution is very sensitive to noise. Fluorescence signals contain\\nmuch noise from experimental settings, background activity, interference of\\nthe calcium-binding domain, and calcium buffering with the cellular spiking\\nprocess.\\n• Neuron type. Different neuron type demonstrates different response kernels.\\nE.g., inhibitory neurons tend to have shorter decay.\\n• High computation cost.\\nDeconvolution is a computation intensive tech-\\nnique.\\nApplying it to a population of neurons needs high computation re-\\nsources.\\nDeconvolution has to be performed to extract spike trains from fluorescence signals.\\nThis method, however, is prone to be numerically unstable and noise sensitive.

Although different\\nkernels, the inference of cross correlation is similar. Taking two signals x(t) and\\ny(t), with their own kernels hx and hy and Point processes Px and Py. According\\nto Equation (2), we get x(t) and y(t) in frequency domain:\\nSx = ˆPxˆhx\\nSy = ˆPyˆhy.\\nThe CSD of two fluorescence signals is then:\\nπxy(ϕ) = E\\n�\\nSx(ϕ) Sy(ϕ)∗�\\n= E[( ˆPxˆhx) ( ˆPyˆhy)∗] = E[ ˆPx ˆP ∗\\ny ] (ˆhx ˆh∗\\ny)\\nInverse Fourier transformation yields in the time domain:\\nρxy = ρPxPy ∗ ρhxhy,\\nγxy = γPxPy ∗ ρhxhy,\\nwhere ρ means cross-correlation, γ means cross-covariance, P is the point process,\\nstanding for underlying spike trains and h is a kernel function, ∗ means convolution\\noperation.\\nTo summarize, in the time domain we have\\nρPxPy\\n∗\\nρhxhy\\n=\\nρxy,\\nand correspondingly in frequency domain\\nE[ ˆPx ˆP ∗\\ny ]\\n·\\n(ˆhxˆh∗\\ny)\\n=\\nπxy(ϕ),\\nin which, ρSxSy can be calculated. ρPxPx is our goal. Dividing CSD of signals by CSD\\nof kernels and transforming it into time domain is the cross-correlation of underlying\\nspike trains. The process is visualized in Figure 10. By performing calculations in\\nthe frequency domain, direct deconvolution can be avoided. Deconvolution in the\\ntime domain can be implemented by spectrum division in the frequency domain. A\\ngraphic demonstration is shown in Figure 11.\\n, \\nFigure 10: Method overview in case that single neuron has its own kernel function.\\nIn time domain, ρxy: cross-correlation of x(t) and y(t); ρPxPy: cross-correlation of\\nunderlying spike trains; ρhxhy: cross-correlation of the kernel function; ∗: convolu-\\ntion operation.

In\\nthe time domain, cross-correlation of underlying spike trains is of our interest; how-\\never not measurable with calcium imaging techniques. What can be measured is\\nfluorescence signals. The cross-correlation of two signals can be, therefore, directly\\ncalculated. By transforming all components into the frequency domain, the CSD of\\nsignals can be obtained. By dividing the CSD of signals by the PSD of the kernel,\\nwe get the CSD of spike trains. Through inverse Fourier transform of CSD of spike\\ntrains, we get the cross-correlation of spike trains in the time domain.\\n, \\nFigure 11: Deconvolution in the time domain as division in the frequency domain.\\nFluorescence signals are modeled as a spike train convolving with a kernel function.\\nThe correlation of underlying spike trains is the target. Instead of performing de-\\nconvolution, correlations of kernels and signals are transformed into the frequency\\ndomain. The power spectral density of signals divides the power spectral density of\\nkernels, yielding the power spectral density of underlying spike trains.

Common proce-\\ndures are substracting background luminance such as neuropil from raw signals.\\nThen, the noise would be removed by bandpass filtering. After the smoothing proce-\\ndure, the baseline F0 would be calculated, and calcium transient (F −F0)/F0 would\\n, \\nbe obtained. In our case, non of them were performed because a different perspective\\nwas focused. Firstly, neuropil itself conceives biological meaning. Slow wave activity\\nin the mouse visual cortex before eye-opening was present both in the neuropil and\\nin neurons [28]. Furthermore, neuropil is a reliable reporter for Up-Down state activ-\\nity in motor, and somatosensory cortex [29]. From the data exported from Suite2p,\\nsubtracting neuropil multiplied by certain factor yields negative signals. There is\\nalso no convincible way to set the value of that factor. Thus neuropil information\\ngenerated from Suite2p was not handled. Besides, starting from the model, the fluo-\\nrescence signal results from the spike train convolving with a kernel function. Peaks\\nin fluorescence signal are assumed to be evoked by spiking activities of the neuron,\\nwhich means raw fluorescence signal is of interest. The baseline could have some\\ninfluence but would not deviate from the result. Therefore no baseline and calcium\\ntransient were calculated. Besides, the filtering procedure can introduce additional\\npeaks, contaminating the raw signal. Correlation inferred by the method is sensitive\\nto peaks and the time that the peaks happen. For this reason, the filtering procedure\\nwas intentionally avoided. Instead, we pick up a scrap of the signal that does not\\nhave obvious peaks and normalize the signal, which regularizes the amplitudes and\\navoids contaminating the signal.\\n]</td>\n",

Investigating\\nexperimental data by manually selecting and examining peaks from neurons made\\nit more meaningful to set each neuron’s private kernel. To estimate the kernel, av-\\nerage spike-triggered fluorescence signal, fitting an exponential function into data,\\nand calculating fractions of adjacent points as a function of unknown parameters\\nwere attempted. Averaging spike-triggered fluorescence signal relies on the available\\nground truth, a critical limitation. Given the fluorescence data model, analytically,\\nfractions of adjacent points are a function of unknown parameters and time steps. As\\nthe time step is very small and the data is noisy, the method could not successfully\\nget the kernel decay parameter. Above all these, the original preferred way was to\\nuse auto-correlation of fluorescence signal as a substitute for kernel auto-correlation,\\nbased on if the underlying spike train of the fluorescence signal is the Poisson pro-\\ncess. The auto-correlation of the spike train is approximately a delta peak, which\\n, \\nbecomes a scaling factor in the frequency domain. Therefore, the PSD of the fluores-\\ncence signal is scaled PSD of the kernel. Applying signal auto-correlation as kernel\\nauto-correlation didn’t generate meaningful results, which is attributed to noise and\\ncomplex structure in the raw data.

       "      <td>[\\nSurrogate fluorescence data with ground truth is needed in scientific research. Cor-\\nresponding tools were developed, such as NAOMi [30]. Data modeling method in\\nthis thesis can be potentially developed into a standalone toolkit to simulate fluores-\\ncence data. It has three core advantages. Firstly two kernel types were provided: a\\nsimple exponential kernel and a beta kernel. With beta kernel function, it is possi-\\nble to customize rising time and decay time separately. As known, different calcium\\nindicators have different response times. Beta function enables more accurate and\\nflexible modeling. Second, exact integration was used to perform convolution nu-\\nmerically. It is a version of fast convolution that is much more efficient and saves\\ncomputing costs, which has already been employed in large network simulation tools\\nsuch as NEST. Thirdly, stochastic point process pre-defines correlation structure of\\nunderlying spike trains. A variety of point processes are available to simulating fluo-\\nrescence data with diverse correlations involving customizing a neuronal population\\nwith higher-order correlations. Furthermore, compared with other spike inference al-\\ngorithms, our method has no dependency on the non-negativity assumption. As long\\nas optical reporters can capture the activity of inhibitory neurons such as GABAer-\\ngic neurons, our approach can be applied to analyze the correlations. The time lag\\nof cross-correlation peaks reveals correlation patterns. Combined with spatial infor-\\nmation, neuronal connectivity, spiking propagation and correlation propagation can\\nbe explored further. In addition, the method is not limited to analyzing calcium\\nimaging data. In principle, it is applicable in any linear convolution model, such as\\nanalyzing simplified model of LFP data. Last but not least, the method is based on\\ncovariance calculation, strongly associated with connectivity inference. Technically,\\nin light of the available covariance of spiking data, connectivity can be inferred effec-\\ntively. Functionally, neuronal correlation and connection have close and reciprocal\\nrelations. Combining these may facilitate a way of using calcium imaging to unravel\\n, \\nthe myth of ”salt and pepper” organized neurons in the mouse primary cortex.\\n, ]</td>\n",

Neural activity sculpts\\nhow neurons transfer information and interact with each other. Different markers or\\nindicators can mediate it. Nowadays, a variety of techniques have been developed to\\nmeasure brain activity, such as single-channel recording, multi-channel recording, lo-\\ncal field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalography\\n(MEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomog-\\nraphy (PET), calcium imaging, optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS), volage-\\nsensitive dye imaging (VSDI). These techniques can be classified into two main cat-\\negories: electrophysiology and imaging techniques. Electrophysiology (patch clamp,\\nmulti-channel recording, LFPs, EEG, MEG) measures and manipulates neuronal\\ndynamics such as spike trains, EPSC, EPSP, and LFP. Imaging techniques (fMRI,\\nPET, calcium imaging, OIS, VSDI) can capture neuronal activities and identify\\nstructures and connections at different scales, from cortex areas and neurons to\\ndendrites and spines. Each technology has advantages and disadvantages regarding\\ninvasiveness and temporal and spatial resolution.

Neuronal spiking is assessed by measuring changes in fluorescence.\\nCalcium imaging together with recombinant DNA technologies and microscopy is\\na powerful tool in modulating and visualizing cellular and molecular interactions.\\nIt can be used not only to observe neuronal activity but also to associate behav-\\nioral characterization with physiological states. Under the field of view (FOV), it is\\npossible to record the activities of hundreds of neurons. It also enables recording free-\\nmoving animals in in-vivo experiments. Two-photon microscopy has excellent spatial\\nresolution, but because the calcium signal is slow, two-photon calcium imaging has\\nvery good spatial resolution but low temporal resolution. Although experiments’\\nsetup and execution could be demanding, calcium imaging can be combined with\\n, \\nelectrophysiology to compensate the low temporal resolution. Figure 2 is an exam-\\nple. Intra-cellular recording directly measures neuronal activities, usually taken as\\nground truth. Calcium imaging records fluorescence signals as an indicator of neu-\\nronal spiking activity, which is indirect. Fluorescence signals and neuronal spikes\\ndiffer from each other. Figure 3 shows single action potential and its evoked calcium\\nsignal, obtained from recording rats’ calyx of Held - a large synaptic terminal in\\nbrainstem slice. We see action potential is quick (in ms) with a short decay, while\\nfluorescence signal (in this case, Fura-2) is slow in several seconds with a longer\\ndecay. The fluorescence signal is much noisier than the action potential. The cal-\\ncium indicator Section 1.1.2 is one key point to facilitate functional imaging with\\nalive animals.

The interaction of calcium ions between the extracellular milieu\\nand intracellular space generates the dynamics of calcium activity. There are mainly\\nthree types of calcium channels on the membrane. See Figure 4. The first is voltage-\\ngated calcium channels (VGCC); the second is receptor-operated calcium channels\\n(ROC); the third is store-operated calcium channels (SOC). VGCC responds to elec-\\ntrical signals induced by calcium binding. It helps to propagate electrical impulses.\\n, \\nFigure 3: Fluorescence signal evoked by a single action potential, adapted from [3].\\nA: intracellular recording. B: Calcium imaging of A.

Helmchen 2012 [5] summarized\\ncalcium dynamics as four processes: calcium binding, influx, extrusion, and diffusion.\\nCalcium influx will increase the intracellular concentration. Extrusion is, therefore,\\nimportant to keep a low intracellular calcium concentration at a balanced level. In\\naddition, free calcium ions, as well as calcium-binding molecules, e.g., most cal-\\ncium indicators, can diffuse. Mathematical equations were used to describe the four\\nprocesses. There are various models for them. For example calcium microdomain\\nmodels high calcium concentration in small spatial scale beneath the membrane due\\nto opening of calcium-permeable channel pores (diffusion process). An 1-dimensional\\ndiffusion model to depict the radial distance dependent calcium redistribution pro-\\ncesses. A leaky ”chemical” cable analogue can model calcium diffusion, extrusion\\nand buffering. In a simplified single-compartment model, an exponential function\\ncan be used to describe the kinetics of the binding process. The calcium signal from\\na neuron is a convolution of the spikes with this exponential function as proposed [5].\\nIn biological calcium imaging experiments, fluorescent calcium indicators is needed\\n, \\nto serve as a proxy for the change of calcium concentration during binding process.\\nFigure 4: Intracelluar calcium dynamics [4].\\nFigure 5: GCaMP working mechanism [4].\\n]   \n",

The first\\ncalcium indicator is Aequorin found in Aequorea victoria in 1962. Nowadays, the\\nindicators used in calcium imaging can be classified into two categories: organic dyes\\nand genetically-encoded calcium indicators(GECIs). The former are small organic\\n, \\nmolecule indicators,e.g. Oregon Green BAPTA-1. The latter are calcium-sensitive\\nfluorescent proteins, which further have two major classes: FRET-based indicators\\nand single protein indicator. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hap-\\npens on the distance change between a donor fluorescent protein and an acceptor\\nfluorescent protein, which can be induced by a conformation change via calcium\\nbinding to the linker. FRET leads to fluorescence emissions so that the intensity\\ncan be recorded. Single protein indicator e.g. the GCaMP family, are circularly per-\\nmutated protein that can sense the conformational change made by calcium binding,\\nmediated by the fluorescence intensity of chromophore inside [5]. GCaMP is a syn-\\nthetic protein containing green fluorscent protein (GFP), calmodulin and a peptide\\nsequence M13 (Figure 5). When bounding to calcium, it emits green luminance\\nwith a peak excitation wavelength of 480 nm and a peak emission wavelength of\\n510 nm. Comparing with organic dyes, GECIs has an advantage of being able to\\ntarget on location in the brain, specific neuron types and subcellular compartments\\nsuch as soma or axons. GECIs also has higher signal-to-noise ratio. To be noticed\\nis, calcium indicator itself has an influence on the intracellular calcium dynamics,\\nwhich can inference the readout information. Besides that, different indicators have\\ndifferent response times, which is an important factor of data modeling. In a recent\\nwork [6], with a large dataset of curated ground truth recordings on zebrafish and\\nmouse, covering different calcium indicators and induction methods, excitatory and\\ninhibitory neurons, different sampling frequency and different brain regions, using\\nregularized deconvolution to generate the linear kernels of fluorescence transient.\\nThe kernels are optimized such that the trace ∆F/F is maximal approximated by\\nconvolving the ground truth spike train with the kernel. It was found that depending\\non animal types, brain regions, neuron types and calcium indicators, the area under\\nthe kernel curve varied. Figure 6 shows different peak amplitudes and decay times\\nwith different calcium indicators. Even for neurons within same dataset, the kernels\\nappear in diversity as well. This suggests that single neuron responds differently\\nwhen underlying action potential goes on.\\n, \\nFigure 6:\\nKernels with different calcium indicator, adapted from [6].\\nAcross\\ndatasets as well as within datasets, kernels vary in terms of amplitude and shape.\\nm: mouse, zf: zebrafish.\\n]   \n",

A common benchmark of data analysis involves motion\\ncorrection, source extraction, cell registration, spike inference, and further analysis\\nof spike trains. Spike inference is very challenging among these steps. Assuming\\nfluorescence signal is the result of action potentials convolving a response function.\\nTo infer the underlying spike train is a so-called \"inverse problem.\" Various methods\\nhave been developed to solve the inverse problem: deconvolution techniques [7, 8],\\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) principle [9], template-matching-based approach [10],\\napproximate Bayesian inference [11].

However, general difficulties in terms of\\nspike inference still exist.

The fluorescence signal fades during the experiment due to\\nthe photochemical destruction of the fluorophore.\\n• Nonlinearity of fluorescence. The saturation curve of the calcium-binding\\nratio can be linearly approximated only within a limited range. Therefore the\\namplitude of observed fluorescence signals does not always linearly represent\\nthe number of underlying action potentials.\\n• Sample resolution. With high microscopy resolution, the single action po-\\ntential is more visible. The low resolution of imaging could lead to missing\\naction potentials.\\n• Noise. Deconvolution is very sensitive to noise. Fluorescence signals contain\\nmuch noise from experimental settings, background activity, interference of\\nthe calcium-binding domain, and calcium buffering with the cellular spiking\\nprocess.\\n• Neuron type. Different neuron type demonstrates different response kernels.\\nE.g., inhibitory neurons tend to have shorter decay.\\n• High computation cost.\\nDeconvolution is a computation intensive tech-\\nnique.\\nApplying it to a population of neurons needs high computation re-\\nsources.\\nDeconvolution has to be performed to extract spike trains from fluorescence signals.\\nThis method, however, is prone to be numerically unstable and noise sensitive.

There are\\ndifferent ways to quantify correlations of neuronal activity, among which the most\\nwell-known are Pearson correlation coefficient, correlation function, and joint peri-\\nstimulus time scatter diagram (JPSTH) [19]. The Pearson correlation coefficient\\nis a linear correlation coefficient with normalized value scope [-1, 1]. Negative val-\\nues mean negative correlations, while positive values indicate positive correlations.\\nAbsolute value towards 1 indicates strong relations, while around zero means two\\nvariables are hardly linearly correlated. The Pearson correlation coefficient cannot\\ncapture a nonlinear relationship between two variables. With JPSTH it is to create\\na two-dimensional scatter diagram of the firings of the two neurons relative to each\\nstimulus onset. Each dot in Figure 7 right panel is a coincidence of the two spike\\ntrains during one stimulus period. Repeating this for each trial, dot density is built\\non the diagonal. With subsequent dynamic correction, including subtraction and\\nscaling, reintegration along the diagonal generates the ultimate JPSTH. The cross-\\n, \\ncorrelation function is commonly used to measure the similarity of two signals. A\\ncross-correlation function is generated by shifting one signal from the other and cal-\\nculating the expectation value of the dot product of two signals within the overlap.\\nProminence peaks in the curve demonstrate correlations between the two signals\\nwith certain time lags (Figure 7, middle panel).\\nPearson correlation\\nCorrelation function\\nJoint JPSTH\\nFigure 7: Correlation quantification.

Implementation of the method, sur-\\nrogate data modeling, and experimental data analysis were completed using Python\\n(version 3.8) in Spyder (version 4.0.1) on a desktop with Intel Core i5-6500 CPU @\\n3.2GHz and 16GB RAM. Experimental data (*.tiff) was pre-processed in Suite2P\\n(version 0.10.1) [14], exported as a python data file (*.npy), and then loaded into\\nSpyder for further processing. Simulation of neurons was carried out with NEST 3.0\\n[20].\\n]   \n",

fluorescence signal increases every time an action potential\\nhappens. The fluorescence signal can be taken as a function of action potential.\\nWe build a function f : x → f(x) in which x is action potential of this neuron in\\ntime series and f(x) is fluorescence signal that can be observed. The function is to\\nconvolve a response kernel. In other words, fluorescence signal is modeled as a point\\nprocess convolving a response kernel, represented below.\\ns = P ∗ h,\\n(1)\\nwhere s is fluorescence signal; P stands for point process. A spike train generated by\\nPoisson processes is one typical example, but it is not limited to it. h is the response\\nkernel function. Two types of kernel functions were investigated: exponential decay\\n, \\nand beta function. Details are in Section 2.2.2.

One of the most prevalent\\npoint processes to simulate stochastic spike trains is Poisson process, in which the\\nspike count within a fixed time interval follows a Poisson distribution.\\nPoisson\\ndistribution is a limit of a binomial distribution. Each spike in a Poissonian spike\\ntrain is independent of the other. The Poisson process can be expressed as\\nP[N = k] = Λk\\nk! e−Λ,\\nΛ = λT,\\nwhere λ is the rate of spike train and T is the simulation time; N is total number of\\nspikes; k is an integer [22]. Whether the rate of generated spike train is a constant or\\na function of time, there are stationary Poisson processes and non-stationary Poisson\\nprocesses.

The cross-covariance function of two spike trains simulated in the\\nsame way is γ(∆) = νδ(∆) [24]. We see the cross-covariance is a delta peak with\\nrate of shared component ν as the amplitude.\\nAlgorithm 3 Simulation of SIP\\nRequire: T ≥ 0\\n1: x(t) ← P(λT)\\n▷ Algorithm 1\\n2: y(t) ← P(µT)\\n▷ Algorithm 1\\n3: z(t) ← P(νT)\\n▷ Algorithm 1\\n4: m(t) ← x(t) + z(t)\\n5: n(t) ← y(t) + z(t)\\n▷ m(t) and n(t) are two correlated Poissonian spike trains with common com-\\nponent z(t).

Cross-correlation function of two simulated spike\\ntrains is ρ(∆) = αβ2δ(∆)+(αβ)2. Cross-covariance function of two simulated spike\\ntrains is γ(∆) = αβ2δ(∆) [24]. We see, both cross-correlation and cross-covariance of\\nthe simulated spike trains are delta peaks.

For jointly stationary signals this can be safely done,\\nas the value of the product at different times t represent different samples with the\\nsame mean. For signals of finite duration T, the time averaging must take the effec-\\ntive signal overlap T − ∆ into account.

In experimental data, it is noticed that the\\ndecay time varies from long (10 seconds or more) to short (2-3 seconds). Therefore\\nit makes sense to customize different kernels for each neuron. Although different\\nkernels, the inference of cross correlation is similar. Taking two signals x(t) and\\ny(t), with their own kernels hx and hy and Point processes Px and Py.

Dividing CSD of signals by CSD\\nof kernels and transforming it into time domain is the cross-correlation of underlying\\nspike trains. The process is visualized in Figure 10. By performing calculations in\\nthe frequency domain, direct deconvolution can be avoided. Deconvolution in the\\ntime domain can be implemented by spectrum division in the frequency domain. A\\ngraphic demonstration is shown in Figure 11.\\n, \\nFigure 10: Method overview in case that single neuron has its own kernel function.\\nIn time domain, ρxy: cross-correlation of x(t) and y(t); ρPxPy: cross-correlation of\\nunderlying spike trains; ρhxhy: cross-correlation of the kernel function; ∗: convolu-\\ntion operation. In frequency domain, πxy(ϕ): CSD of two signals x(t) and y(t); ˆhxˆh∗\\ny:\\ncross-spectral density of kernel function; ˆPx ˆPy: CSD of underlying spike trains. In\\nthe time domain, cross-correlation of underlying spike trains is of our interest; how-\\never not measurable with calcium imaging techniques. What can be measured is\\nfluorescence signals. The cross-correlation of two signals can be, therefore, directly\\ncalculated. By transforming all components into the frequency domain, the CSD of\\nsignals can be obtained. By dividing the CSD of signals by the PSD of the kernel,\\nwe get the CSD of spike trains. Through inverse Fourier transform of CSD of spike\\ntrains, we get the cross-correlation of spike trains in the time domain.\\n, \\nFigure 11: Deconvolution in the time domain as division in the frequency domain.\\nFluorescence signals are modeled as a spike train convolving with a kernel function.\\nThe correlation of underlying spike trains is the target. Instead of performing de-\\nconvolution, correlations of kernels and signals are transformed into the frequency\\ndomain. The power spectral density of signals divides the power spectral density of\\nkernels, yielding the power spectral density of underlying spike trains. Bringing it\\ninto the time domain, we get the target cross-correlation.\\n, \\n]   \n",

Given neurons\\nx and y, we then have:\\nU = M ∗ I,\\nγUxUy = γIxIy ∗ ρMM,\\nwhere U is membrane potential; M is impulse response of membrane; I is PSC;\\nγUxUy is cross-covariance of the membrane potential; γIxIy is cross-covariance of\\nPSC of the two neurons, and ρMM is the auto-correlation of impulse response of\\n, \\nmembrane.\\nSame as in Section 2.3.2, it yields in frequency domain:\\nE[ˆIx ˆI∗\\ny] ( ˆ\\nM ˆ\\nM∗) = πUxUy(ϕ)\\n⇒\\nE[ˆIx ˆI∗\\ny] =\\nπUxUy(ϕ)\\n( ˆ\\nM ˆ\\nM∗)\\n.\\nBring E[ˆIx ˆI∗\\ny] to time domain, we can get the cross-covariance of PSC (γIxIy).\\nTo be emphasized is that this methodology applies only to linear neuron model, such\\nas leaky integrate-and-fire model, not for other neuron models such as conductance-\\nbased neuron model or adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron model. Be-\\nsides, the methodology applies to membrane potential exceptionally in the sub-\\nthreshold regime, meaning the neurons do not fire.\\n]   \n",

Ex-\\nperimental data was provided by Prof. Björn Kampa’s group from RWTH Aachen\\nUniversity. Experiments were performed with 10-20 weeks old transgenic mice with\\ncranial windows implanted on V1. Images were obtained using two-photon calcium\\nimaging of spontaneous activity recorded in GCaMP6s-labeled neurons in V1 layer\\n2/3 of while mice were head fixed on a light-weight running wheel. No stimulus was\\npresented. The microscope had a frame rate of 30 Hz. Pre-processing procedures\\nwere performed beforehand as summarized in Figure 12. Image stacks were loaded\\ninto Suite2p.\\nSeveral operations were performed by Suite2p: image registration\\nvia phase correlation which corrects for the effects of brain movement with a rigid\\nalignment algorithm; ROI detection, which generates identified ROIs with positive\\nweights for each pixel; ROI labeling and quality control.\\nSeveral *.npy files are\\ngenerated by Suite2p and are loaded into Python for further handling. In Python,\\nROIs that are not identified as cells were eliminated. Signals are normalized by\\nsubtracting the global mean and dividing by the standard deviation of a stationary\\npart in the signal. In the case of experimental data, the kernel is unknown. As\\nthe auto-correlation of one signal is a bi-exponential function with the same time\\nconstant as the kernel, it can extract the kernel function from the auto-correlation\\nof the signal. Therefore next step is to calculate the auto-correlation of signals and\\nfit an exponential function into the data of half-signal auto-correlation. The fitting\\nprocess is performed by method scipy.optimize.curve_fit, which applies non-linear\\n, \\nleast squares to fit an exponential function and uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algo-\\nrithm to solve the minimization problem. It yields estimated values of parameters\\nand variances of the estimate as the goodness of fitting. To validate fitting process\\nfurther, the natural logarithm of fluorescence auto-covariance was calculated, which\\nis expected as a linear function.\\nFigure 12: Pre-processing of experimental data. *.tiff are image stacks recorded\\nfrom experiments.

Component rates are[5, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 1, 2, 0.5] Hz respec-\\ntively. Simulation is done by exact integration with exponential kernel [21]. The\\ndecay time constant of the kernel is 0.2 s. The simulation time is 10 seconds. The\\nsimulation time step is 0.001 seconds. The top left panel is raw simulated fluores-\\ncence signals of three neurons with underlying spike trains marked as small bars with\\nthe same color at the bottom. The top right panel is kernel auto-correlations. Each\\nrow below is an analysis of a pair of neurons. In the left column are cross-covariance\\nof fluorescence signals. In the right column are the estimated cross-covariance and\\nits ground truth.\\nSeen from above, by applying the method of cross-correlation inference on surro-\\ngate data, estimated cross-covariance in highly in agreement with ground truth.\\nWhether it is an independent Poisson process or correlated Poisson process, simple\\ncorrelation or complex correlation structure, second-order correlation or higher-order\\ncorrelations, the method can always capture the correlation structure of underlying\\nspike trains accurately. It is worth mentioning that the represented plots above in\\nthis section are about the accurate cross-covariance inference of spike trains from\\n, \\nsurrogate data. In fact, the same fidelity goes for cross-correlation inference. This is\\nbecause cross-correlation and cross-covariance have the same structure, only differ\\nin an offset component that is generated the multiplication of the global mean.

It was first assumed that all neurons\\nshare the same response kernel-induced calcium change and use auto-correlation of\\neither signal as a substitute for auto-correlation of the kernel. The generated results\\nwere not consistent and explainable. Inspecting data, decay time and amplitudes\\nof peaks vary between neurons. It is, therefore, reasonable to estimate kernel func-\\ntion individually. Auto-correlation of normalized fluorescence trace was calculated.\\nBased on this, an exponential function was fitted into half of the data upon a specific\\ntime window. As the fitting results are sensitive to window size, time windows size\\nwas varied from 0.1 to 20 seconds with step 0.1 seconds to see the trend of time\\n, \\nconstant. The minimum value of the time constant was picked as the final value of\\nthe parameter in the kernel. It was noticed that the time constant curve upon differ-\\nent time windows tends to have different trends. In Figure 22 left side, the value of\\nthe estimated time constant stabilizes with increasing time window. In contrast, on\\nthe right side, it declines and then increases with a larger standard deviation error,\\nwhich seems to have something to do with whether the auto-correlation of the signal\\nhas zero-crossing within the time window. Looking into more neurons, as seen from\\nFigure 23, it is true that neurons’ time constants are different, which aligns with the\\ninitial speculation.\\nFigure 22: Kernel fitting of experimental data.\\nThe final optimized time constants for the 48 neurons are presented in Figure 23.\\nThe shortest estimated time constant is 0.94 s, and the largest 6.06 s.\\n, \\nFigure 23: Time constants of different neurons\\n]   \n",

Figure 28 was estimated by using inferred cross-\\ncovariance of underlying spike trains. We see same information on the diagonals.\\n, \\nBeside that, additional connectives are visible. Comparing Figure 27 and Figure 28,\\nthe latter gives more details in the connectivity matrix. To be pointed out, con-\\nnectivity estimation is a preliminary study as listed in this thesis.

MIP was simulated with parameters of experimental data. Number of neu-\\nrons: 10. Time constants of the 10 neurons are [3, 3.5, 3.1, 2.5, 2.2, 1.7, 1.8, 1.5, 2.0,\\n2.6]. Rate of mother Poisson process is 10 Hz. Copy ratio for the 10 neurons are\\n, \\nfrom 0.1 to 1 with step 0.1 respectively. Simulation duration 627 seconds. The first\\n10 seconds was cut off to eliminate the effect from rising period. Figure 29 illustrates\\nthe estimated times constants and the actual time constant for each neuron. Esti-\\nmation for some neurons are very good, such as neuron #0, #3 and #9. For other\\nneurons, there are obvious deviations. Maximum deviation is less than one second.\\nUsing the estimated time constant, cross-covariance are inferred. Results can be\\nseen in Figure 30. Cross-covariance estimation has a high fidelity, whatever using\\nestimated time constant or actual time constant in the kernel. It has a tolerance\\nfor errors in the time constant estimation. In contrast, the cross-correlation has\\nan offset difference between estimation and ground truth, both in using estimated\\ntime constants and actual time constants, although the cross-correlation structure\\ndoesn’t differ. Interesting is, in some cases cross-correlation estimation using esti-\\nmated time constant has better accuracy than using actual time constant. To be\\nnoticed is in Section 3.1, simulated neurons have same kernel. Both cross-covariance\\nand cross-correlation and ground truths are in high agreement. Here single neuron\\nhave different kernels. This could be a reason for the offset difference in the cross-\\ncorrelations. Figure 31 demonstrates the estimation results by using estimated time\\nconstants. Copy ratio increases from neuron #0 to #9. We see neurons with high\\ncopy ratios have high peak amplitudes.\\nFigure 29: Compare estimated time constant with ground truth. τest: estimated\\ntime constant of kernel. τact: actual time constant of the kernel.\\n, \\nFigure 30: Compare inferred cross-covariance and cross-correlation with ground\\ntruths.

2.3.4, the method can also be used to analze membrane\\npotential. As for implementation, Nest 3.0 [20] provides a convenient and reliable\\nway instead of simulating surrogate data in Python. Two single iaf_PSC_alpha\\nneurons were created in NEST. Each is connected to a spike generator (sg1 and\\nsg2) and multimeter (vm1 and vm2), as can be seen in Figure 32. Spike timing of\\nsg1 and sg2 are injected with pre-simulated spike trains using SIP. Both of them\\nare compounded Poisson process with a common spike train and a private spike\\n, \\ntrain (SIP). The simulation aims to record membrane potential in the sub-threshold\\nregime, meaning neither neuron fires. Neuron and simulation parameters are shown\\nin Table 1, among which the membrane time constant was intentionally set as 200 ms,\\nwhich is not close to the real biological neuron but to simulate a very slow response\\nof the membrane. The synaptic time constant is then very small in comparison.\\nIn this sense, the cross-covariance of PSC is analog to incoming spike trains’ cross-\\ncovariance. Analysis results can be found in Figure 33, where we see the shape of\\ncross-covariance and cross-correlations are well re-produced.

cross-correlation of underlying spike\\ntrains from fluorescence signals, without performing deconvolution. Mathematical\\nfoundations of the method were introduced. The method has experimented with\\nsurrogate data, simulated with the same kernel but different correlation structures,\\nsuch as the independent homogeneous Poisson process, independent in-homogeneous\\nPoisson process, correlated spike trains, and spike trains with higher-order correla-\\ntions. It turned out the correlation structure can be accurately re-represented. The\\nmethod was also tried on experimental data obtained from calcium imaging of the\\nmouse’s primary visual cortex. With pre-processed data, neuronal correlations can\\nbe revealed. Furthermore, to validate the procedure of handling experimental data,\\nthe same procedure was tried with surrogate data simulated by MIP with differ-\\nent kernels. Results exhibited that the cross-covariance of underlying spike trains\\ncould be faultlessly captured. Furthermore, the cross-correlation structure strongly\\nagreed with the ground truth, although there were offset differences. Finally, the\\nsame mythology can be used to analyze correlation of pres-synaptic spike trains,\\nmore specifically post-synaptic current, from membrane potentials in a sub-threshold\\nregime based on a shotnoise model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. Overall, the\\nmethod has a wide application range and is reliable. It saves computational costs\\nby transferring deconvolution in the time domain into division operation in the fre-\\nquency domain. There are some noteworthy aspects to mention when developing\\nand applying the method.\\n]   \n",

Common proce-\\ndures are substracting background luminance such as neuropil from raw signals.\\nThen, the noise would be removed by bandpass filtering. After the smoothing proce-\\ndure, the baseline F0 would be calculated, and calcium transient (F −F0)/F0 would\\n, \\nbe obtained. In our case, non of them were performed because a different perspective\\nwas focused. Firstly, neuropil itself conceives biological meaning. Slow wave activity\\nin the mouse visual cortex before eye-opening was present both in the neuropil and\\nin neurons [28]. Furthermore, neuropil is a reliable reporter for Up-Down state activ-\\nity in motor, and somatosensory cortex [29]. From the data exported from Suite2p,\\nsubtracting neuropil multiplied by certain factor yields negative signals. There is\\nalso no convincible way to set the value of that factor. Thus neuropil information\\ngenerated from Suite2p was not handled. Besides, starting from the model, the fluo-\\nrescence signal results from the spike train convolving with a kernel function. Peaks\\nin fluorescence signal are assumed to be evoked by spiking activities of the neuron,\\nwhich means raw fluorescence signal is of interest. The baseline could have some\\ninfluence but would not deviate from the result. Therefore no baseline and calcium\\ntransient were calculated. Besides, the filtering procedure can introduce additional\\npeaks, contaminating the raw signal. Correlation inferred by the method is sensitive\\nto peaks and the time that the peaks happen. For this reason, the filtering procedure\\nwas intentionally avoided. Instead, we pick up a scrap of the signal that does not\\nhave obvious peaks and normalize the signal, which regularizes the amplitudes and\\navoids contaminating the signal.\\n]   \n",

Various methods were adopted to\\nderive the kernel. Firstly we assumed neurons have the same kernel. Investigating\\nexperimental data by manually selecting and examining peaks from neurons made\\nit more meaningful to set each neuron’s private kernel. To estimate the kernel, av-\\nerage spike-triggered fluorescence signal, fitting an exponential function into data,\\nand calculating fractions of adjacent points as a function of unknown parameters\\nwere attempted. Averaging spike-triggered fluorescence signal relies on the available\\nground truth, a critical limitation. Given the fluorescence data model, analytically,\\nfractions of adjacent points are a function of unknown parameters and time steps. As\\nthe time step is very small and the data is noisy, the method could not successfully\\nget the kernel decay parameter. Above all these, the original preferred way was to\\nuse auto-correlation of fluorescence signal as a substitute for kernel auto-correlation,\\nbased on if the underlying spike train of the fluorescence signal is the Poisson pro-\\ncess. The auto-correlation of the spike train is approximately a delta peak, which\\n, \\nbecomes a scaling factor in the frequency domain. Therefore, the PSD of the fluores-\\ncence signal is scaled PSD of the kernel. Applying signal auto-correlation as kernel\\nauto-correlation didn’t generate meaningful results, which is attributed to noise and\\ncomplex structure in the raw data. The oscillations and small structures in signal\\nauto-correlation make the correlation structure invisible in the results. Therefore, a\\nkernel fitting was eventually applied and worked well.\\n]   \n",

scientific research. Cor-\\nresponding tools were developed, such as NAOMi [30]. Data modeling method in\\nthis thesis can be potentially developed into a standalone toolkit to simulate fluores-\\ncence data. It has three core advantages. Firstly two kernel types were provided: a\\nsimple exponential kernel and a beta kernel. With beta kernel function, it is possi-\\nble to customize rising time and decay time separately. As known, different calcium\\nindicators have different response times. Beta function enables more accurate and\\nflexible modeling. Second, exact integration was used to perform convolution nu-\\nmerically. It is a version of fast convolution that is much more efficient and saves\\ncomputing costs, which has already been employed in large network simulation tools\\nsuch as NEST. Thirdly, stochastic point process pre-defines correlation structure of\\nunderlying spike trains. A variety of point processes are available to simulating fluo-\\nrescence data with diverse correlations involving customizing a neuronal population\\nwith higher-order correlations. Furthermore, compared with other spike inference al-\\ngorithms, our method has no dependency on the non-negativity assumption. As long\\nas optical reporters can capture the activity of inhibitory neurons such as GABAer-\\ngic neurons, our approach can be applied to analyze the correlations. The time lag\\nof cross-correlation peaks reveals correlation patterns. Combined with spatial infor-\\nmation, neuronal connectivity, spiking propagation and correlation propagation can\\nbe explored further. In addition, the method is not limited to analyzing calcium\\nimaging data. In principle, it is applicable in any linear convolution model, such as\\nanalyzing simplified model of LFP data. Last but not least, the method is based on\\ncovariance calculation, strongly associated with connectivity inference. Technically,\\nin light of the available covariance of spiking data, connectivity can be inferred effec-\\ntively. Functionally, neuronal correlation and connection have close and reciprocal\\nrelations. Combining these may facilitate a way of using calcium imaging to unravel\\n, \\nthe myth of ”salt and pepper” organized neurons in the mouse primary cortex.\\n, ]   \n",
