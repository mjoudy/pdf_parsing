In this thesis, we propose and\\ndemonstrate a new method to obtain spike train correlations by deconvolution of\\nthe correlations of fluorescence signals, avoiding the reconstruction of spike trains\\naltogether. Working with surrogate data generated by various point processes, it\\nis shown that the method captures the correlation structure faultlessly.\\nThe in-\\nferred cross-covariance is represented with experimental data obtained from calcium\\nimaging of the mouse’s primary visual cortex, with which a connectivity inference\\nis attempted. In addition, a validation process by applying the procedure of han-\\ndling experimental data on surrogate data demonstrated that the cross-covariance\\nof underlying spike trains could be estimated with high reliability. Finally, we show\\nthat the mythology can be used to analyze the correlation of membrane potentials\\nin a sub-threshold regime based on a shotnoise model of simple linear-modeled neu-\\nrons.\\n',\n",

Firstly two kernel types were provided: a\\nsimple exponential kernel and a beta kernel. With beta kernel function, it is possi-\\nble to customize rising time and decay time separately. As known, different calcium\\nindicators have different response times. Beta function enables more accurate and\\nflexible modeling.

A variety of point processes are available to simulating fluo-\\nrescence data with diverse correlations involving customizing a neuronal population\\nwith higher-order correlations. Furthermore, compared with other spike inference al-\\ngorithms, our method has no dependency on the non-negativity assumption.

In this thesis, we propose and\\ndemonstrate a new method to obtain spike train correlations by deconvolution of\\nthe correlations of fluorescence signals, avoiding the reconstruction of spike trains\\naltogether. Working with surrogate data generated by various point processes, it\\nis shown that the method captures the correlation structure faultlessly.\\nThe in-\\nferred cross-covariance is represented with experimental data obtained from calcium\\nimaging of the mouse’s primary visual cortex, with which a connectivity inference\\nis attempted. In addition, a validation process by applying the procedure of han-\\ndling experimental data on surrogate data demonstrated that the cross-covariance\\nof underlying spike trains could be estimated with high reliability.

Different markers or\\nindicators can mediate it. Nowadays, a variety of techniques have been developed to\\nmeasure brain activity, such as single-channel recording, multi-channel recording, lo-\\ncal field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalography\\n(MEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomog-\\nraphy (PET), calcium imaging, optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS), volage-\\nsensitive dye imaging (VSDI). These techniques can be classified into two main cat-\\negories: electrophysiology and imaging techniques. Electrophysiology (patch clamp,\\nmulti-channel recording, LFPs, EEG, MEG) measures and manipulates neuronal\\ndynamics such as spike trains, EPSC, EPSP, and LFP. Imaging techniques (fMRI,\\nPET, calcium imaging, OIS, VSDI) can capture neuronal activities and identify\\nstructures and connections at different scales, from cortex areas and neurons to\\ndendrites and spines. Each technology has advantages and disadvantages regarding\\ninvasiveness and temporal and spatial resolution. Therefore, combining two or more\\ntechnologies to reveal the complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity from\\na single neuron to the population level is common.

       "      <td>[As one of the imaging techniques, calcium imaging has become more popular in the\\nseveral decades. Neuronal spiking is assessed by measuring changes in fluorescence.\\nCalcium imaging together with recombinant DNA technologies and microscopy is\\na powerful tool in modulating and visualizing cellular and molecular interactions.\\nIt can be used not only to observe neuronal activity but also to associate behav-\\nioral characterization with physiological states. Under the field of view (FOV), it is\\npossible to record the activities of hundreds of neurons. It also enables recording free-\\nmoving animals in in-vivo experiments. Two-photon microscopy has excellent spatial\\nresolution, but because the calcium signal is slow, two-photon calcium imaging has\\nvery good spatial resolution but low temporal resolution. Although experiments’\\nsetup and execution could be demanding, calcium imaging can be combined with\\n, 1 Introduction\\n3\\n, electrophysiology to compensate the low temporal resolution. Figure 2 is an exam-\\nple. Intra-cellular recording directly measures neuronal activities, usually taken as\\nground truth. Calcium imaging records fluorescence signals as an indicator of neu-\\nronal spiking activity, which is indirect. Fluorescence signals and neuronal spikes\\ndiffer from each other. Figure 3 shows single action potential and its evoked calcium\\nsignal, obtained from recording rats’ calyx of Held - a large synaptic terminal in\\nbrainstem slice. We see action potential is quick (in ms) with a short decay, while\\nfluorescence signal (in this case, Fura-2) is slow in several seconds with a longer\\ndecay. The fluorescence signal is much noisier than the action potential. The cal-\\ncium indicator Section 1.1.2 is one key point to facilitate functional imaging with\\nalive animals. For example, with a cranial window over visual cortex of a transgenic\\nmouse, it is able to image large scale of neuronal activities on layer 2/3 and layer\\n4.\\n, &lt;image: DeviceRGB, width: 330, height: 223, bpc: 8&gt;, &lt;image: DeviceRGB, width: 388, height: 219, bpc: 8&gt;, Figure 2:\\nIn-vivo calcium imaging accompanied with simultaneous electrophys-\\niology recording on genetically modified mice to produce a calcium indicator\\n(GCaMP6s, GCaMP6f) in neurons of the primary visual cortex, adapted from [2].\\nLeft: Experimental design that recruits two-photon imaging and cell-attached record-\\ning simultaneously.

They are open when binding with\\nexcitatory neurotransmitters, e.g., glutamate, AmPAR, NMDA. Besides, the endo-\\nplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria can release calcium intracellularly. SOC\\nis activated by stromal interaction molecule (STIM) proteins accumulated at ER\\nand plasma membrane (PM) junctions [4]. In excitatory neurons, when membrane\\nis depolarized, VGCC open and calcium enormously flux in. Therefore calcium con-\\ncentration is associated with action potential events. Helmchen 2012 [5] summarized\\ncalcium dynamics as four processes: calcium binding, influx, extrusion, and diffusion.\\nCalcium influx will increase the intracellular concentration. Extrusion is, therefore,\\nimportant to keep a low intracellular calcium concentration at a balanced level. In\\naddition, free calcium ions, as well as calcium-binding molecules, e.g., most cal-\\ncium indicators, can diffuse. Mathematical equations were used to describe the four\\nprocesses. There are various models for them. For example calcium microdomain\\nmodels high calcium concentration in small spatial scale beneath the membrane due\\nto opening of calcium-permeable channel pores (diffusion process). An 1-dimensional\\ndiffusion model to depict the radial distance dependent calcium redistribution pro-\\ncesses. A leaky ”chemical” cable analogue can model calcium diffusion, extrusion\\nand buffering. In a simplified single-compartment model, an exponential function\\ncan be used to describe the kinetics of the binding process. The calcium signal from\\na neuron is a convolution of the spikes with this exponential function as proposed [5].\\nIn biological calcium imaging experiments, fluorescent calcium indicators is needed\\n, 1 Introduction\\n5\\n, to serve as a proxy for the change of calcium concentration during binding process.\\n, &lt;image: DeviceRGB, width: 771, height: 610, bpc: 8&gt;, Figure 4: Intracelluar calcium dynamics [4].\\n, &lt;image: DeviceRGB, width: 721, height: 259, bpc: 8&gt;, Figure 5: GCaMP working mechanism [4].\\n]</td>\n",

Nowadays, the\\nindicators used in calcium imaging can be classified into two categories: organic dyes\\nand genetically-encoded calcium indicators(GECIs). The former are small organic\\n, 1 Introduction\\n6\\n, molecule indicators,e.g. Oregon Green BAPTA-1. The latter are calcium-sensitive\\nfluorescent proteins, which further have two major classes: FRET-based indicators\\nand single protein indicator. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hap-\\npens on the distance change between a donor fluorescent protein and an acceptor\\nfluorescent protein, which can be induced by a conformation change via calcium\\nbinding to the linker. FRET leads to fluorescence emissions so that the intensity\\ncan be recorded. Single protein indicator e.g. the GCaMP family, are circularly per-\\nmutated protein that can sense the conformational change made by calcium binding,\\nmediated by the fluorescence intensity of chromophore inside [5]. GCaMP is a syn-\\nthetic protein containing green fluorscent protein (GFP), calmodulin and a peptide\\nsequence M13 (Figure 5). When bounding to calcium, it emits green luminance\\nwith a peak excitation wavelength of 480 nm and a peak emission wavelength of\\n510 nm. Comparing with organic dyes, GECIs has an advantage of being able to\\ntarget on location in the brain, specific neuron types and subcellular compartments\\nsuch as soma or axons. GECIs also has higher signal-to-noise ratio. To be noticed\\nis, calcium indicator itself has an influence on the intracellular calcium dynamics,\\nwhich can inference the readout information. Besides that, different indicators have\\ndifferent response times, which is an important factor of data modeling. In a recent\\nwork [6], with a large dataset of curated ground truth recordings on zebrafish and\\nmouse, covering different calcium indicators and induction methods, excitatory and\\ninhibitory neurons, different sampling frequency and different brain regions, using\\nregularized deconvolution to generate the linear kernels of fluorescence transient.\\nThe kernels are optimized such that the trace ∆F/F is maximal approximated by\\nconvolving the ground truth spike train with the kernel. It was found that depending\\non animal types, brain regions, neuron types and calcium indicators, the area under\\nthe kernel curve varied. Figure 6 shows different peak amplitudes and decay times\\nwith different calcium indicators. Even for neurons within same dataset, the kernels\\nappear in diversity as well.

Fluorescence signals contain\\nmuch noise from experimental settings, background activity, interference of\\nthe calcium-binding domain, and calcium buffering with the cellular spiking\\nprocess.\\n, • Neuron type.

No stimulus was\\npresented. The microscope had a frame rate of 30 Hz. Pre-processing procedures\\nwere performed beforehand as summarized in Figure 12. Image stacks were loaded\\ninto Suite2p.\\nSeveral operations were performed by Suite2p: image registration\\nvia phase correlation which corrects for the effects of brain movement with a rigid\\nalignment algorithm; ROI detection, which generates identified ROIs with positive\\nweights for each pixel; ROI labeling and quality control.\\nSeveral *.npy files are\\ngenerated by Suite2p and are loaded into Python for further handling. In Python,\\nROIs that are not identified as cells were eliminated. Signals are normalized by\\nsubtracting the global mean and dividing by the standard deviation of a stationary\\npart in the signal. In the case of experimental data, the kernel is unknown. As\\nthe auto-correlation of one signal is a bi-exponential function with the same time\\nconstant as the kernel, it can extract the kernel function from the auto-correlation\\nof the signal. Therefore next step is to calculate the auto-correlation of signals and\\nfit an exponential function into the data of half-signal auto-correlation. The fitting\\nprocess is performed by method scipy.optimize.curve_fit, which applies non-linear\\n, 2 Materials and Methods\\n26\\n, least squares to fit an exponential function and uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algo-\\nrithm to solve the minimization problem. It yields estimated values of parameters\\nand variances of the estimate as the goodness of fitting. To validate fitting process\\nfurther, the natural logarithm of fluorescence auto-covariance was calculated, which\\nis expected as a linear function.\\n, &lt;image: DeviceRGB, width: 3704, height: 2139, bpc: 8&gt;, Figure 12: Pre-processing of experimental data. *.tiff are image stacks recorded\\nfrom experiments.

In contrast, the cross-correlation has\\nan offset difference between estimation and ground truth, both in using estimated\\ntime constants and actual time constants, although the cross-correlation structure\\ndoesn’t differ. Interesting is, in some cases cross-correlation estimation using esti-\\nmated time constant has better accuracy than using actual time constant. To be\\nnoticed is in Section 3.1, simulated neurons have same kernel. Both cross-covariance\\nand cross-correlation and ground truths are in high agreement. Here single neuron\\nhave different kernels. This could be a reason for the offset difference in the cross-\\ncorrelations. Figure 31 demonstrates the estimation results by using estimated time\\nconstants. Copy ratio increases from neuron #0 to #9.

Mathematical\\nfoundations of the method were introduced. The method has experimented with\\nsurrogate data, simulated with the same kernel but different correlation structures,\\nsuch as the independent homogeneous Poisson process, independent in-homogeneous\\nPoisson process, correlated spike trains, and spike trains with higher-order correla-\\ntions. It turned out the correlation structure can be accurately re-represented. The\\nmethod was also tried on experimental data obtained from calcium imaging of the\\nmouse’s primary visual cortex. With pre-processed data, neuronal correlations can\\nbe revealed. Furthermore, to validate the procedure of handling experimental data,\\nthe same procedure was tried with surrogate data simulated by MIP with differ-\\nent kernels. Results exhibited that the cross-covariance of underlying spike trains\\ncould be faultlessly captured. Furthermore, the cross-correlation structure strongly\\nagreed with the ground truth, although there were offset differences. Finally, the\\nsame mythology can be used to analyze correlation of pres-synaptic spike trains,\\nmore specifically post-synaptic current, from membrane potentials in a sub-threshold\\nregime based on a shotnoise model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. Overall, the\\nmethod has a wide application range and is reliable. It saves computational costs\\nby transferring deconvolution in the time domain into division operation in the fre-\\nquency domain.

Common proce-\\ndures are substracting background luminance such as neuropil from raw signals.\\nThen, the noise would be removed by bandpass filtering. After the smoothing proce-\\ndure, the baseline F0 would be calculated, and calcium transient (F −F0)/F0 would\\n, 4 Conclusion and discussion\\n51\\n, be obtained. In our case, non of them were performed because a different perspective\\nwas focused. Firstly, neuropil itself conceives biological meaning. Slow wave activity\\nin the mouse visual cortex before eye-opening was present both in the neuropil and\\nin neurons [28]. Furthermore, neuropil is a reliable reporter for Up-Down state activ-\\nity in motor, and somatosensory cortex [29]. From the data exported from Suite2p,\\nsubtracting neuropil multiplied by certain factor yields negative signals. There is\\nalso no convincible way to set the value of that factor. Thus neuropil information\\ngenerated from Suite2p was not handled. Besides, starting from the model, the fluo-\\nrescence signal results from the spike train convolving with a kernel function. Peaks\\nin fluorescence signal are assumed to be evoked by spiking activities of the neuron,\\nwhich means raw fluorescence signal is of interest. The baseline could have some\\ninfluence but would not deviate from the result. Therefore no baseline and calcium\\ntransient were calculated. Besides, the filtering procedure can introduce additional\\npeaks, contaminating the raw signal. Correlation inferred by the method is sensitive\\nto peaks and the time that the peaks happen. For this reason, the filtering procedure\\nwas intentionally avoided. Instead, we pick up a scrap of the signal that does not\\nhave obvious peaks and normalize the signal, which regularizes the amplitudes and\\navoids contaminating the signal.\\n]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[With experimental data, the kernel is unknown. Various methods were adopted to\\nderive the kernel. Firstly we assumed neurons have the same kernel. Investigating\\nexperimental data by manually selecting and examining peaks from neurons made\\nit more meaningful to set each neuron’s private kernel. To estimate the kernel, av-\\nerage spike-triggered fluorescence signal, fitting an exponential function into data,\\nand calculating fractions of adjacent points as a function of unknown parameters\\nwere attempted. Averaging spike-triggered fluorescence signal relies on the available\\nground truth, a critical limitation. Given the fluorescence data model, analytically,\\nfractions of adjacent points are a function of unknown parameters and time steps. As\\nthe time step is very small and the data is noisy, the method could not successfully\\nget the kernel decay parameter. Above all these, the original preferred way was to\\nuse auto-correlation of fluorescence signal as a substitute for kernel auto-correlation,\\nbased on if the underlying spike train of the fluorescence signal is the Poisson pro-\\ncess. The auto-correlation of the spike train is approximately a delta peak, which\\n, 4 Conclusion and discussion\\n52\\n, becomes a scaling factor in the frequency domain. Therefore, the PSD of the fluores-\\ncence signal is scaled PSD of the kernel. Applying signal auto-correlation as kernel\\nauto-correlation didn’t generate meaningful results, which is attributed to noise and\\ncomplex structure in the raw data. The oscillations and small structures in signal\\nauto-correlation make the correlation structure invisible in the results. Therefore, a\\nkernel fitting was eventually applied and worked well.\\n]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Surrogate fluorescence data with ground truth is needed in scientific research. Cor-\\nresponding tools were developed, such as NAOMi [30]. Data modeling method in\\nthis thesis can be potentially developed into a standalone toolkit to simulate fluores-\\ncence data. It has three core advantages. Firstly two kernel types were provided: a\\nsimple exponential kernel and a beta kernel. With beta kernel function, it is possi-\\nble to customize rising time and decay time separately. As known, different calcium\\nindicators have different response times. Beta function enables more accurate and\\nflexible modeling. Second, exact integration was used to perform convolution nu-\\nmerically. It is a version of fast convolution that is much more efficient and saves\\ncomputing costs, which has already been employed in large network simulation tools\\nsuch as NEST. Thirdly, stochastic point process pre-defines correlation structure of\\nunderlying spike trains. A variety of point processes are available to simulating fluo-\\nrescence data with diverse correlations involving customizing a neuronal population\\nwith higher-order correlations. Furthermore, compared with other spike inference al-\\ngorithms, our method has no dependency on the non-negativity assumption. As long\\nas optical reporters can capture the activity of inhibitory neurons such as GABAer-\\ngic neurons, our approach can be applied to analyze the correlations. The time lag\\nof cross-correlation peaks reveals correlation patterns. Combined with spatial infor-\\nmation, neuronal connectivity, spiking propagation and correlation propagation can\\nbe explored further. In addition, the method is not limited to analyzing calcium\\nimaging data. In principle, it is applicable in any linear convolution model, such as\\nanalyzing simplified model of LFP data. Last but not least, the method is based on\\ncovariance calculation, strongly associated with connectivity inference. Technically,\\nin light of the available covariance of spiking data, connectivity can be inferred effec-\\ntively. Functionally, neuronal correlation and connection have close and reciprocal\\nrelations. Combining these may facilitate a way of using calcium imaging to unravel\\n, 4 Conclusion and discussion\\n53\\n, the myth of ”salt and pepper” organized neurons in the mouse primary cortex.\\n, Acknowledgements\\n54\\n]</td>\n",

The cross-covariance function of two spike trains simulated in the\\nsame way is γ(∆) = νδ(∆) [24]. We see the cross-covariance is a delta peak with\\nrate of shared component ν as the amplitude.\\n   \n",

activities of a large neuronal pop-\\nulation.\\nHowever, analyzing fluorescence signals is challenging.\\nReconstructing\\nspike trains from fluorescence signals by deconvolution is very sensitive to noise,\\nnot stable, and linked with high computational costs. In this thesis, we propose and\\ndemonstrate a new method to obtain spike train correlations by deconvolution of\\nthe correlations of fluorescence signals, avoiding the reconstruction of spike trains\\naltogether. Working with surrogate data generated by various point processes, it\\nis shown that the method captures the correlation structure faultlessly.\\nThe in-\\nferred cross-covariance is represented with experimental data obtained from calcium\\nimaging of the mouse’s primary visual cortex, with which a connectivity inference\\nis attempted. In addition, a validation process by applying the procedure of han-\\ndling experimental data on surrogate data demonstrated that the cross-covariance\\nof underlying spike trains could be estimated with high reliability. Finally, we show\\nthat the mythology can be used to analyze the correlation of membrane potentials\\nin a sub-threshold regime based on a shotnoise model of simple linear-modeled neu-\\nrons.\\n, Contents\\n3\\n]   \n",

Neural activity sculpts\\nhow neurons transfer information and interact with each other. Different markers or\\nindicators can mediate it. Nowadays, a variety of techniques have been developed to\\nmeasure brain activity, such as single-channel recording, multi-channel recording, lo-\\ncal field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalography\\n(MEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomog-\\nraphy (PET), calcium imaging, optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS), volage-\\nsensitive dye imaging (VSDI). These techniques can be classified into two main cat-\\negories: electrophysiology and imaging techniques. Electrophysiology (patch clamp,\\nmulti-channel recording, LFPs, EEG, MEG) measures and manipulates neuronal\\ndynamics such as spike trains, EPSC, EPSP, and LFP. Imaging techniques (fMRI,\\nPET, calcium imaging, OIS, VSDI) can capture neuronal activities and identify\\nstructures and connections at different scales, from cortex areas and neurons to\\ndendrites and spines. Each technology has advantages and disadvantages regarding\\ninvasiveness and temporal and spatial resolution.

Neuronal spiking is assessed by measuring changes in fluorescence.\\nCalcium imaging together with recombinant DNA technologies and microscopy is\\na powerful tool in modulating and visualizing cellular and molecular interactions.\\nIt can be used not only to observe neuronal activity but also to associate behav-\\nioral characterization with physiological states. Under the field of view (FOV), it is\\npossible to record the activities of hundreds of neurons. It also enables recording free-\\nmoving animals in in-vivo experiments. Two-photon microscopy has excellent spatial\\nresolution, but because the calcium signal is slow, two-photon calcium imaging has\\nvery good spatial resolution but low temporal resolution. Although experiments’\\nsetup and execution could be demanding, calcium imaging can be combined with\\n, 1 Introduction\\n3\\n, electrophysiology to compensate the low temporal resolution. Figure 2 is an exam-\\nple. Intra-cellular recording directly measures neuronal activities, usually taken as\\nground truth. Calcium imaging records fluorescence signals as an indicator of neu-\\nronal spiking activity, which is indirect. Fluorescence signals and neuronal spikes\\ndiffer from each other. Figure 3 shows single action potential and its evoked calcium\\nsignal, obtained from recording rats’ calyx of Held - a large synaptic terminal in\\nbrainstem slice. We see action potential is quick (in ms) with a short decay, while\\nfluorescence signal (in this case, Fura-2) is slow in several seconds with a longer\\ndecay. The fluorescence signal is much noisier than the action potential. The cal-\\ncium indicator Section 1.1.2 is one key point to facilitate functional imaging with\\nalive animals.

The interaction of calcium ions between the extracellular milieu\\nand intracellular space generates the dynamics of calcium activity. There are mainly\\nthree types of calcium channels on the membrane. See Figure 4.

They are open when binding with\\nexcitatory neurotransmitters, e.g., glutamate, AmPAR, NMDA. Besides, the endo-\\nplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria can release calcium intracellularly. SOC\\nis activated by stromal interaction molecule (STIM) proteins accumulated at ER\\nand plasma membrane (PM) junctions [4]. In excitatory neurons, when membrane\\nis depolarized, VGCC open and calcium enormously flux in. Therefore calcium con-\\ncentration is associated with action potential events. Helmchen 2012 [5] summarized\\ncalcium dynamics as four processes: calcium binding, influx, extrusion, and diffusion.\\nCalcium influx will increase the intracellular concentration. Extrusion is, therefore,\\nimportant to keep a low intracellular calcium concentration at a balanced level. In\\naddition, free calcium ions, as well as calcium-binding molecules, e.g., most cal-\\ncium indicators, can diffuse. Mathematical equations were used to describe the four\\nprocesses. There are various models for them. For example calcium microdomain\\nmodels high calcium concentration in small spatial scale beneath the membrane due\\nto opening of calcium-permeable channel pores (diffusion process). An 1-dimensional\\ndiffusion model to depict the radial distance dependent calcium redistribution pro-\\ncesses. A leaky ”chemical” cable analogue can model calcium diffusion, extrusion\\nand buffering. In a simplified single-compartment model, an exponential function\\ncan be used to describe the kinetics of the binding process. The calcium signal from\\na neuron is a convolution of the spikes with this exponential function as proposed [5].\\nIn biological calcium imaging experiments, fluorescent calcium indicators is needed\\n, 1 Introduction\\n5\\n, to serve as a proxy for the change of calcium concentration during binding process.\\n, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 771, height: 610, bpc: 8>, Figure 4: Intracelluar calcium dynamics [4].\\n, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 721, height: 259, bpc: 8>, Figure 5: GCaMP working mechanism [4].\\n]   \n",

The first\\ncalcium indicator is Aequorin found in Aequorea victoria in 1962. Nowadays, the\\nindicators used in calcium imaging can be classified into two categories: organic dyes\\nand genetically-encoded calcium indicators(GECIs). The former are small organic\\n, 1 Introduction\\n6\\n, molecule indicators,e.g. Oregon Green BAPTA-1. The latter are calcium-sensitive\\nfluorescent proteins, which further have two major classes: FRET-based indicators\\nand single protein indicator. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hap-\\npens on the distance change between a donor fluorescent protein and an acceptor\\nfluorescent protein, which can be induced by a conformation change via calcium\\nbinding to the linker. FRET leads to fluorescence emissions so that the intensity\\ncan be recorded. Single protein indicator e.g. the GCaMP family, are circularly per-\\nmutated protein that can sense the conformational change made by calcium binding,\\nmediated by the fluorescence intensity of chromophore inside [5]. GCaMP is a syn-\\nthetic protein containing green fluorscent protein (GFP), calmodulin and a peptide\\nsequence M13 (Figure 5). When bounding to calcium, it emits green luminance\\nwith a peak excitation wavelength of 480 nm and a peak emission wavelength of\\n510 nm. Comparing with organic dyes, GECIs has an advantage of being able to\\ntarget on location in the brain, specific neuron types and subcellular compartments\\nsuch as soma or axons. GECIs also has higher signal-to-noise ratio. To be noticed\\nis, calcium indicator itself has an influence on the intracellular calcium dynamics,\\nwhich can inference the readout information. Besides that, different indicators have\\ndifferent response times, which is an important factor of data modeling. In a recent\\nwork [6], with a large dataset of curated ground truth recordings on zebrafish and\\nmouse, covering different calcium indicators and induction methods, excitatory and\\ninhibitory neurons, different sampling frequency and different brain regions, using\\nregularized deconvolution to generate the linear kernels of fluorescence transient.\\nThe kernels are optimized such that the trace ∆F/F is maximal approximated by\\nconvolving the ground truth spike train with the kernel. It was found that depending\\non animal types, brain regions, neuron types and calcium indicators, the area under\\nthe kernel curve varied.

In the meantime, analyzing fluorescence signals is more complex\\nthan analyzing signals from electrophysiology. The raw data of calcium imaging\\nis movie or image stacks. A common benchmark of data analysis involves motion\\ncorrection, source extraction, cell registration, spike inference, and further analysis\\nof spike trains. Spike inference is very challenging among these steps. Assuming\\nfluorescence signal is the result of action potentials convolving a response function.\\nTo infer the underlying spike train is a so-called \"inverse problem.\" Various methods\\nhave been developed to solve the inverse problem: deconvolution techniques [7, 8],\\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) principle [9], template-matching-based approach [10],\\napproximate Bayesian inference [11]. Applications and packages are available online:\\nCellSort [12], CaImAn [13], Suite2P [14], MLspike [15], CASCADE [6] and so on. It\\nhas been great progress with these works. However, general difficulties in terms of\\nspike inference still exist. The main aspects are outlined below.\\n, 1 Introduction\\n8\\n, • Overexpression.\\nFluorescence overexpression potentially leads to toxicity.\\nNeuron nuclear is bright due to the accumulation of calcium indicators.\\n, • Photobleaching. The fluorescence signal fades during the experiment due to\\nthe photochemical destruction of the fluorophore.\\n, • Nonlinearity of fluorescence. The saturation curve of the calcium-binding\\nratio can be linearly approximated only within a limited range. Therefore the\\namplitude of observed fluorescence signals does not always linearly represent\\nthe number of underlying action potentials.\\n, • Sample resolution. With high microscopy resolution, the single action po-\\ntential is more visible. The low resolution of imaging could lead to missing\\naction potentials.\\n, • Noise. Deconvolution is very sensitive to noise. Fluorescence signals contain\\nmuch noise from experimental settings, background activity, interference of\\nthe calcium-binding domain, and calcium buffering with the cellular spiking\\nprocess.\\n, • Neuron type.

There are\\ndifferent ways to quantify correlations of neuronal activity, among which the most\\nwell-known are Pearson correlation coefficient, correlation function, and joint peri-\\nstimulus time scatter diagram (JPSTH) [19]. The Pearson correlation coefficient\\nis a linear correlation coefficient with normalized value scope [-1, 1]. Negative val-\\nues mean negative correlations, while positive values indicate positive correlations.\\nAbsolute value towards 1 indicates strong relations, while around zero means two\\nvariables are hardly linearly correlated. The Pearson correlation coefficient cannot\\ncapture a nonlinear relationship between two variables. With JPSTH it is to create\\na two-dimensional scatter diagram of the firings of the two neurons relative to each\\nstimulus onset. Each dot in Figure 7 right panel is a coincidence of the two spike\\ntrains during one stimulus period. Repeating this for each trial, dot density is built\\non the diagonal. With subsequent dynamic correction, including subtraction and\\nscaling, reintegration along the diagonal generates the ultimate JPSTH. The cross-\\n, 1 Introduction\\n10\\n, correlation function is commonly used to measure the similarity of two signals. A\\ncross-correlation function is generated by shifting one signal from the other and cal-\\nculating the expectation value of the dot product of two signals within the overlap.\\nProminence peaks in the curve demonstrate correlations between the two signals\\nwith certain time lags (Figure 7, middle panel).\\n, Pearson correlation\\nCorrelation function\\nJoint JPSTH\\n, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 270, height: 233, bpc: 8>, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 211, height: 215, bpc: 8>, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 448, height: 469, bpc: 8>, Figure 7: Correlation quantification.

A reliable analysis of fluorescence signals is important to correctly reveal\\nthe biological meaning on a neuronal level. Among all analyses, inferring spike trains\\nfrom fluorescence signals is challenging but a prerequisite of other steps. On the\\nother hand, neuronal information lies in firing rates and is delivered by correlations.\\nA common methodology for correlation analysis is first to extract discrete spikes\\nor spike rates via deconvolution and then calculate neuronal correlations. However,\\nthe reconstruction of spike trains by deconvolution is very sensitive to noise, not\\nstable, and linked with high computational costs. In this thesis, we propose and\\ndemonstrate a new method to obtain spike train correlations by deconvolution of\\nthe correlations of fluorescence signals, avoiding the reconstruction of spike trains\\naltogether.\\n, 2 Materials and Methods\\n11\\n]   \n",

Implementation of the method, sur-\\nrogate data modeling, and experimental data analysis were completed using Python\\n(version 3.8) in Spyder (version 4.0.1) on a desktop with Intel Core i5-6500 CPU @\\n3.2GHz and 16GB RAM. Experimental data (*.tiff) was pre-processed in Suite2P\\n(version 0.10.1) [14], exported as a python data file (*.npy), and then loaded into\\nSpyder for further processing.

every time an action potential\\nhappens. The fluorescence signal can be taken as a function of action potential.\\nWe build a function f : x → f(x) in which x is action potential of this neuron in\\ntime series and f(x) is fluorescence signal that can be observed. The function is to\\nconvolve a response kernel. In other words, fluorescence signal is modeled as a point\\nprocess convolving a response kernel, represented below.\\n, s = P ∗ h,\\n(1)\\n, where s is fluorescence signal; P stands for point process. A spike train generated by\\nPoisson processes is one typical example, but it is not limited to it. h is the response\\nkernel function. Two types of kernel functions were investigated: exponential decay\\n, 2 Materials and Methods\\n12\\n, and beta function. Details are in Section 2.2.2.

One of the most prevalent\\npoint processes to simulate stochastic spike trains is Poisson process, in which the\\nspike count within a fixed time interval follows a Poisson distribution.\\nPoisson\\ndistribution is a limit of a binomial distribution. Each spike in a Poissonian spike\\ntrain is independent of the other.

corresponding variables; ˆPx\\nstands for the underlying spike train in the frequency domain; h is the kernel function\\nand ˆhˆh∗ is power spectral density (PSD) of the kernel; λ is a scaling factor. Because\\nthe point process can be expressed as the Dirac function in time series and in the\\nfrequency domain Dirac function is transformed as a constant, the power spectral\\ndensity of a signal equals the scaled power spectral density of the corresponding\\nkernel. This enables, in the case of an unknown kernel, the PSD of kernels can be\\nrepresented by the PSD of the signal. What’s more, according to Wiener–Khinchin\\ntheorem, the Fourier transform of auto-correlation of signal in time series is the PSD\\nof the signal. By performing inverse Fourier transform of the PSD, it yields signal\\nauto-correlation in the time domain:\\n]   \n",

Although it could be estimated from repeated trials, it is common\\nto replace it by time averaging. For jointly stationary signals this can be safely done,\\nas the value of the product at different times t represent different samples with the\\nsame mean. For signals of finite duration T, the time averaging must take the effec-\\ntive signal overlap T − ∆ into account. So we practically estimate correlations from\\nsignals of length T as\\n]   \n",

The traditional method\\nis to first extract each spike train by deconvolving the fluorescence signal. Here\\ninstead of performing deconvolution, we bring components in Equation (5) into the\\nfrequency domain. With known CSD of the signals and calculated PSD of the kernel\\n(Section 2.2.2), we get CSD of underlying spike trains. Transforming it into the time\\ndomain, we get the cross-correlation of the spike trains.\\n, 2 Materials and Methods\\n21\\n, Different kernels for neurons\\n, In Section 2.3.2, we inferred the cross-correlation of spike trains by assuming all neu-\\nrons share the same response function. In experimental data, it is noticed that the\\ndecay time varies from long (10 seconds or more) to short (2-3 seconds). Therefore\\nit makes sense to customize different kernels for each neuron. Although different\\nkernels, the inference of cross correlation is similar. Taking two signals x(t) and\\ny(t), with their own kernels hx and hy and Point processes Px and Py.

function.\\nThe correlation of underlying spike trains is the target. Instead of performing de-\\nconvolution, correlations of kernels and signals are transformed into the frequency\\ndomain. The power spectral density of signals divides the power spectral density of\\nkernels, yielding the power spectral density of underlying spike trains. Bringing it\\ninto the time domain, we get the target cross-correlation.\\n, 2 Materials and Methods\\n24\\n]   \n",

Ex-\\nperimental data was provided by Prof. Björn Kampa’s group from RWTH Aachen\\nUniversity. Experiments were performed with 10-20 weeks old transgenic mice with\\ncranial windows implanted on V1. Images were obtained using two-photon calcium\\nimaging of spontaneous activity recorded in GCaMP6s-labeled neurons in V1 layer\\n2/3 of while mice were head fixed on a light-weight running wheel. No stimulus was\\npresented. The microscope had a frame rate of 30 Hz. Pre-processing procedures\\nwere performed beforehand as summarized in Figure 12. Image stacks were loaded\\ninto Suite2p.\\nSeveral operations were performed by Suite2p: image registration\\nvia phase correlation which corrects for the effects of brain movement with a rigid\\nalignment algorithm; ROI detection, which generates identified ROIs with positive\\nweights for each pixel; ROI labeling and quality control.\\nSeveral *.npy files are\\ngenerated by Suite2p and are loaded into Python for further handling. In Python,\\nROIs that are not identified as cells were eliminated. Signals are normalized by\\nsubtracting the global mean and dividing by the standard deviation of a stationary\\npart in the signal. In the case of experimental data, the kernel is unknown. As\\nthe auto-correlation of one signal is a bi-exponential function with the same time\\nconstant as the kernel, it can extract the kernel function from the auto-correlation\\nof the signal. Therefore next step is to calculate the auto-correlation of signals and\\nfit an exponential function into the data of half-signal auto-correlation. The fitting\\nprocess is performed by method scipy.optimize.curve_fit, which applies non-linear\\n, 2 Materials and Methods\\n26\\n, least squares to fit an exponential function and uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algo-\\nrithm to solve the minimization problem. It yields estimated values of parameters\\nand variances of the estimate as the goodness of fitting. To validate fitting process\\nfurther, the natural logarithm of fluorescence auto-covariance was calculated, which\\nis expected as a linear function.\\n, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 3704, height: 2139, bpc: 8>, Figure 12: Pre-processing of experimental data. *.tiff are image stacks recorded\\nfrom experiments.

It was first assumed that all neurons\\nshare the same response kernel-induced calcium change and use auto-correlation of\\neither signal as a substitute for auto-correlation of the kernel. The generated results\\nwere not consistent and explainable. Inspecting data, decay time and amplitudes\\nof peaks vary between neurons. It is, therefore, reasonable to estimate kernel func-\\ntion individually. Auto-correlation of normalized fluorescence trace was calculated.\\nBased on this, an exponential function was fitted into half of the data upon a specific\\ntime window. As the fitting results are sensitive to window size, time windows size\\nwas varied from 0.1 to 20 seconds with step 0.1 seconds to see the trend of time\\n, 3 Results\\n37\\n, constant. The minimum value of the time constant was picked as the final value of\\nthe parameter in the kernel. It was noticed that the time constant curve upon differ-\\nent time windows tends to have different trends. In Figure 22 left side, the value of\\nthe estimated time constant stabilizes with increasing time window. In contrast, on\\nthe right side, it declines and then increases with a larger standard deviation error,\\nwhich seems to have something to do with whether the auto-correlation of the signal\\nhas zero-crossing within the time window. Looking into more neurons, as seen from\\nFigure 23, it is true that neurons’ time constants are different, which aligns with the\\ninitial speculation.\\n, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 420, height: 708, bpc: 8>, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 420, height: 708, bpc: 8>, Figure 22: Kernel fitting of experimental data.\\n, The final optimized time constants for the 48 neurons are presented in Figure 23.\\nThe shortest estimated time constant is 0.94 s, and the largest 6.06 s.\\n, 3 Results\\n38\\n, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 512, height: 293, bpc: 8>, Figure 23: Time constants of different neurons\\n]   \n",

Therefore we applied experimental data processing flow on as set of simulated\\nfluorescence based on MIP process. Then compare the inferred results with ground\\ntruth. MIP was simulated with parameters of experimental data. Number of neu-\\nrons: 10. Time constants of the 10 neurons are [3, 3.5, 3.1, 2.5, 2.2, 1.7, 1.8, 1.5, 2.0,\\n2.6]. Rate of mother Poisson process is 10 Hz. Copy ratio for the 10 neurons are\\n, 3 Results\\n44\\n, from 0.1 to 1 with step 0.1 respectively. Simulation duration 627 seconds. The first\\n10 seconds was cut off to eliminate the effect from rising period. Figure 29 illustrates\\nthe estimated times constants and the actual time constant for each neuron. Esti-\\nmation for some neurons are very good, such as neuron #0, #3 and #9. For other\\nneurons, there are obvious deviations. Maximum deviation is less than one second.\\nUsing the estimated time constant, cross-covariance are inferred. Results can be\\nseen in Figure 30. Cross-covariance estimation has a high fidelity, whatever using\\nestimated time constant or actual time constant in the kernel. It has a tolerance\\nfor errors in the time constant estimation. In contrast, the cross-correlation has\\nan offset difference between estimation and ground truth, both in using estimated\\ntime constants and actual time constants, although the cross-correlation structure\\ndoesn’t differ. Interesting is, in some cases cross-correlation estimation using esti-\\nmated time constant has better accuracy than using actual time constant. To be\\nnoticed is in Section 3.1, simulated neurons have same kernel. Both cross-covariance\\nand cross-correlation and ground truths are in high agreement. Here single neuron\\nhave different kernels. This could be a reason for the offset difference in the cross-\\ncorrelations. Figure 31 demonstrates the estimation results by using estimated time\\nconstants. Copy ratio increases from neuron #0 to #9. We see neurons with high\\ncopy ratios have high peak amplitudes.\\n, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 512, height: 293, bpc: 8>, Figure 29: Compare estimated time constant with ground truth. τest: estimated\\ntime constant of kernel. τact: actual time constant of the kernel.\\n, 3 Results\\n45\\n, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 282, height: 714, bpc: 8>, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 282, height: 714, bpc: 8>, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 282, height: 714, bpc: 8>, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 282, height: 714, bpc: 8>, Figure 30: Compare inferred cross-covariance and cross-correlation with ground\\ntruths.

As for implementation, Nest 3.0 [20] provides a convenient and reliable\\nway instead of simulating surrogate data in Python. Two single iaf_PSC_alpha\\nneurons were created in NEST. Each is connected to a spike generator (sg1 and\\nsg2) and multimeter (vm1 and vm2), as can be seen in Figure 32. Spike timing of\\nsg1 and sg2 are injected with pre-simulated spike trains using SIP. Both of them\\nare compounded Poisson process with a common spike train and a private spike\\n, 3 Results\\n47\\n, train (SIP). The simulation aims to record membrane potential in the sub-threshold\\nregime, meaning neither neuron fires. Neuron and simulation parameters are shown\\nin Table 1, among which the membrane time constant was intentionally set as 200 ms,\\nwhich is not close to the real biological neuron but to simulate a very slow response\\nof the membrane. The synaptic time constant is then very small in comparison.\\nIn this sense, the cross-covariance of PSC is analog to incoming spike trains’ cross-\\ncovariance. Analysis results can be found in Figure 33, where we see the shape of\\ncross-covariance and cross-correlations are well re-produced.

Mathematical\\nfoundations of the method were introduced. The method has experimented with\\nsurrogate data, simulated with the same kernel but different correlation structures,\\nsuch as the independent homogeneous Poisson process, independent in-homogeneous\\nPoisson process, correlated spike trains, and spike trains with higher-order correla-\\ntions. It turned out the correlation structure can be accurately re-represented. The\\nmethod was also tried on experimental data obtained from calcium imaging of the\\nmouse’s primary visual cortex. With pre-processed data, neuronal correlations can\\nbe revealed. Furthermore, to validate the procedure of handling experimental data,\\nthe same procedure was tried with surrogate data simulated by MIP with differ-\\nent kernels. Results exhibited that the cross-covariance of underlying spike trains\\ncould be faultlessly captured. Furthermore, the cross-correlation structure strongly\\nagreed with the ground truth, although there were offset differences. Finally, the\\nsame mythology can be used to analyze correlation of pres-synaptic spike trains,\\nmore specifically post-synaptic current, from membrane potentials in a sub-threshold\\nregime based on a shotnoise model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. Overall, the\\nmethod has a wide application range and is reliable. It saves computational costs\\nby transferring deconvolution in the time domain into division operation in the fre-\\nquency domain. There are some noteworthy aspects to mention when developing\\nand applying the method.\\n]   \n",

a\\nkernel function. It is a concise model focusing on the most significant characteristics\\nof the signal without considering baseline and noise. It was assumed that additional\\nbaseline fluctuations and noise would not significantly influence the method itself.\\n, 4 Conclusion and discussion\\n50\\n, This assumption was verified by adding component shotnoise to the signal. As it\\nturns out, the inferred results do not deviate much. In Figure 34, adding shortnoise\\nmakes the signal more noisy. Baseline fluctuations can lead the signal into a negative\\narea around zero. However, the main correlation structure can still be deciphered.\\n, <image: DeviceRGB, width: 1175, height: 1091, bpc: 8>, Figure 34: Add shotnoise as fluorescence baseline.

Common proce-\\ndures are substracting background luminance such as neuropil from raw signals.\\nThen, the noise would be removed by bandpass filtering. After the smoothing proce-\\ndure, the baseline F0 would be calculated, and calcium transient (F −F0)/F0 would\\n, 4 Conclusion and discussion\\n51\\n, be obtained. In our case, non of them were performed because a different perspective\\nwas focused. Firstly, neuropil itself conceives biological meaning. Slow wave activity\\nin the mouse visual cortex before eye-opening was present both in the neuropil and\\nin neurons [28]. Furthermore, neuropil is a reliable reporter for Up-Down state activ-\\nity in motor, and somatosensory cortex [29]. From the data exported from Suite2p,\\nsubtracting neuropil multiplied by certain factor yields negative signals. There is\\nalso no convincible way to set the value of that factor. Thus neuropil information\\ngenerated from Suite2p was not handled. Besides, starting from the model, the fluo-\\nrescence signal results from the spike train convolving with a kernel function. Peaks\\nin fluorescence signal are assumed to be evoked by spiking activities of the neuron,\\nwhich means raw fluorescence signal is of interest. The baseline could have some\\ninfluence but would not deviate from the result. Therefore no baseline and calcium\\ntransient were calculated. Besides, the filtering procedure can introduce additional\\npeaks, contaminating the raw signal. Correlation inferred by the method is sensitive\\nto peaks and the time that the peaks happen. For this reason, the filtering procedure\\nwas intentionally avoided. Instead, we pick up a scrap of the signal that does not\\nhave obvious peaks and normalize the signal, which regularizes the amplitudes and\\navoids contaminating the signal.\\n]   \n",

Various methods were adopted to\\nderive the kernel. Firstly we assumed neurons have the same kernel. Investigating\\nexperimental data by manually selecting and examining peaks from neurons made\\nit more meaningful to set each neuron’s private kernel. To estimate the kernel, av-\\nerage spike-triggered fluorescence signal, fitting an exponential function into data,\\nand calculating fractions of adjacent points as a function of unknown parameters\\nwere attempted. Averaging spike-triggered fluorescence signal relies on the available\\nground truth, a critical limitation. Given the fluorescence data model, analytically,\\nfractions of adjacent points are a function of unknown parameters and time steps. As\\nthe time step is very small and the data is noisy, the method could not successfully\\nget the kernel decay parameter. Above all these, the original preferred way was to\\nuse auto-correlation of fluorescence signal as a substitute for kernel auto-correlation,\\nbased on if the underlying spike train of the fluorescence signal is the Poisson pro-\\ncess. The auto-correlation of the spike train is approximately a delta peak, which\\n, 4 Conclusion and discussion\\n52\\n, becomes a scaling factor in the frequency domain. Therefore, the PSD of the fluores-\\ncence signal is scaled PSD of the kernel. Applying signal auto-correlation as kernel\\nauto-correlation didn’t generate meaningful results, which is attributed to noise and\\ncomplex structure in the raw data.

Cor-\\nresponding tools were developed, such as NAOMi [30]. Data modeling method in\\nthis thesis can be potentially developed into a standalone toolkit to simulate fluores-\\ncence data. It has three core advantages. Firstly two kernel types were provided: a\\nsimple exponential kernel and a beta kernel. With beta kernel function, it is possi-\\nble to customize rising time and decay time separately. As known, different calcium\\nindicators have different response times. Beta function enables more accurate and\\nflexible modeling. Second, exact integration was used to perform convolution nu-\\nmerically. It is a version of fast convolution that is much more efficient and saves\\ncomputing costs, which has already been employed in large network simulation tools\\nsuch as NEST. Thirdly, stochastic point process pre-defines correlation structure of\\nunderlying spike trains. A variety of point processes are available to simulating fluo-\\nrescence data with diverse correlations involving customizing a neuronal population\\nwith higher-order correlations. Furthermore, compared with other spike inference al-\\ngorithms, our method has no dependency on the non-negativity assumption. As long\\nas optical reporters can capture the activity of inhibitory neurons such as GABAer-\\ngic neurons, our approach can be applied to analyze the correlations. The time lag\\nof cross-correlation peaks reveals correlation patterns. Combined with spatial infor-\\nmation, neuronal connectivity, spiking propagation and correlation propagation can\\nbe explored further. In addition, the method is not limited to analyzing calcium\\nimaging data. In principle, it is applicable in any linear convolution model, such as\\nanalyzing simplified model of LFP data. Last but not least, the method is based on\\ncovariance calculation, strongly associated with connectivity inference. Technically,\\nin light of the available covariance of spiking data, connectivity can be inferred effec-\\ntively. Functionally, neuronal correlation and connection have close and reciprocal\\nrelations. Combining these may facilitate a way of using calcium imaging to unravel\\n, 4 Conclusion and discussion\\n53\\n, the myth of ”salt and pepper” organized neurons in the mouse primary cortex.\\n, Acknowledgements\\n54\\n]   \n",

like to express my deep gratitude to Prof. Stefan Rot-\\nter, who initiated the idea and supervised the thesis. Without his guidance in every\\nstep throughout the process, it wouldn’t have been possible for me to complete it.\\nI benefit from his broad knowledge, patience as a supervisor, and creativity, focus,\\ncritical thinking, logical reasoning and stress resistance as a researcher.\\n, I am sincerely thankful to Prof. Björn Kampa for providing the data and offering\\nthe opportunity to witness how the experiments were performed, which was very\\nuseful in my understanding of the data. I also want to thank him for the advice and\\ndiscussions on the project and insightful literature recommendations. My thanks\\nalso go to Sophie Wetz from Prof. Kampa’s group, who is very supportive and open,\\nwith whom I always had pleasant and helpful interactions.\\n, I would like to specially thank Dr. Han Lu for her support personally and providing\\nvaluable and constructive suggestions to revise my writing.\\n, References\\n55\\n]   \n",

In this thesis, we propose and\\ndemonstrate a new method to obtain spike train correlations by deconvolution of\\nthe correlations of fluorescence signals, avoiding the reconstruction of spike trains\\naltogether. Working with surrogate data generated by various point processes, it\\nis shown that the method captures the correlation structure faultlessly.\\nThe in-\\nferred cross-covariance is represented with experimental data obtained from calcium\\nimaging of the mouse’s primary visual cortex, with which a connectivity inference\\nis attempted. In addition, a validation process by applying the procedure of han-\\ndling experimental data on surrogate data demonstrated that the cross-covariance\\nof underlying spike trains could be estimated with high reliability. Finally, we show\\nthat the mythology can be used to analyze the correlation of membrane potentials\\nin a sub-threshold regime based on a shotnoise model of simple linear-modeled neu-\\nrons.\\n',\n",

The latter are calcium-sensitive\\nfluorescent proteins, which further have two major classes: FRET-based indicators\\nand single protein indicator. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hap-\\npens on the distance change between a donor fluorescent protein and an acceptor\\nfluorescent protein, which can be induced by a conformation change via calcium\\nbinding to the linker. FRET leads to fluorescence emissions so that the intensity\\ncan be recorded. Single protein indicator e.g. the GCaMP family, are circularly per-\\nmutated protein that can sense the conformational change made by calcium binding,\\nmediated by the fluorescence intensity of chromophore inside [5]. GCaMP is a syn-\\nthetic protein containing green fluorscent protein (GFP), calmodulin and a peptide\\nsequence M13 (Figure 5). When bounding to calcium, it emits green luminance\\nwith a peak excitation wavelength of 480 nm and a peak emission wavelength of\\n510 nm. Comparing with organic dyes, GECIs has an advantage of being able to\\ntarget on location in the brain, specific neuron types and subcellular compartments\\nsuch as soma or axons. GECIs also has higher signal-to-noise ratio. To be noticed\\nis, calcium indicator itself has an influence on the intracellular calcium dynamics,\\nwhich can inference the readout information. Besides that, different indicators have\\ndifferent response times, which is an important factor of data modeling. In a recent\\nwork [6], with a large dataset of curated ground truth recordings on zebrafish and\\nmouse, covering different calcium indicators and induction methods, excitatory and\\ninhibitory neurons, different sampling frequency and different brain regions, using\\nregularized deconvolution to generate the linear kernels of fluorescence transient.\\nThe kernels are optimized such that the trace ∆F/F is maximal approximated by\\nconvolving the ground truth spike train with the kernel. It was found that depending\\non animal types, brain regions, neuron types and calcium indicators, the area under\\nthe kernel curve varied. Figure 6 shows different peak amplitudes and decay times\\nwith different calcium indicators. Even for neurons within same dataset, the kernels\\nappear in diversity as well. This suggests that single neuron responds differently\\nwhen underlying action potential goes on.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': 'This thesis presents a new method to infer the cross-correlation of underlying spike\\ntrains from fluorescence signals, without performing deconvolution. Mathematical\\nfoundations of the method were introduced. The method has experimented with\\nsurrogate data, simulated with the same kernel but different correlation structures,\\nsuch as the independent homogeneous Poisson process, independent in-homogeneous\\nPoisson process, correlated spike trains, and spike trains with higher-order correla-\\ntions. It turned out the correlation structure can be accurately re-represented. The\\nmethod was also tried on experimental data obtained from calcium imaging of the\\nmouse’s primary visual cortex. With pre-processed data, neuronal correlations can\\nbe revealed. Furthermore, to validate the procedure of handling experimental data,\\nthe same procedure was tried with surrogate data simulated by MIP with differ-\\nent kernels. Results exhibited that the cross-covariance of underlying spike trains\\ncould be faultlessly captured. Furthermore, the cross-correlation structure strongly\\nagreed with the ground truth, although there were offset differences. Finally, the\\nsame mythology can be used to analyze correlation of pres-synaptic spike trains,\\nmore specifically post-synaptic current, from membrane potentials in a sub-threshold\\nregime based on a shotnoise model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. Overall, the\\nmethod has a wide application range and is reliable. It saves computational costs\\nby transferring deconvolution in the time domain into division operation in the fre-\\nquency domain. There are some noteworthy aspects to mention when developing\\nand applying the method.\\n',\n",

Furthermore, neuropil is a reliable reporter for Up-Down state activ-\\nity in motor, and somatosensory cortex [29]. From the data exported from Suite2p,\\nsubtracting neuropil multiplied by certain factor yields negative signals. There is\\nalso no convincible way to set the value of that factor.

Data modeling method in\\nthis thesis can be potentially developed into a standalone toolkit to simulate fluores-\\ncence data. It has three core advantages. Firstly two kernel types were provided: a\\nsimple exponential kernel and a beta kernel. With beta kernel function, it is possi-\\nble to customize rising time and decay time separately. As known, different calcium\\nindicators have different response times. Beta function enables more accurate and\\nflexible modeling. Second, exact integration was used to perform convolution nu-\\nmerically. It is a version of fast convolution that is much more efficient and saves\\ncomputing costs, which has already been employed in large network simulation tools\\nsuch as NEST. Thirdly, stochastic point process pre-defines correlation structure of\\nunderlying spike trains. A variety of point processes are available to simulating fluo-\\nrescence data with diverse correlations involving customizing a neuronal population\\nwith higher-order correlations. Furthermore, compared with other spike inference al-\\ngorithms, our method has no dependency on the non-negativity assumption. As long\\nas optical reporters can capture the activity of inhibitory neurons such as GABAer-\\ngic neurons, our approach can be applied to analyze the correlations. The time lag\\nof cross-correlation peaks reveals correlation patterns. Combined with spatial infor-\\nmation, neuronal connectivity, spiking propagation and correlation propagation can\\nbe explored further. In addition, the method is not limited to analyzing calcium\\nimaging data. In principle, it is applicable in any linear convolution model, such as\\nanalyzing simplified model of LFP data. Last but not least, the method is based on\\ncovariance calculation, strongly associated with connectivity inference. Technically,\\nin light of the available covariance of spiking data, connectivity can be inferred effec-\\ntively. Functionally, neuronal correlation and connection have close and reciprocal\\nrelations. Combining these may facilitate a way of using calcium imaging to unravel\\n',\n",
